## Introduction

The goal of spatialsample is to provide functions and classes for spatial resampling to use with [rsample](https://rsample.tidymodels.org/), including:

- [spatial clustering cross-validation](https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6352393)
- [spatial block cross-validation](https://doi.org/10.1111/ecog.02881)
- [spatially buffered cross-validation](https://doi.org/10.1111/geb.12161)
- [leave-location-out cross-validation](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2017.12.001)

Like [rsample](https://rsample.tidymodels.org/), spatialsample provides building blocks for creating and analyzing resamples of a spatial data set but does not include code for modeling or computing statistics. The resampled data sets created by spatialsample are efficient and do not have much memory overhead.

## Installation

You can install the released version of spatialsample from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("spatialsample")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tidymodels/spatialsample")
```
## Example

The most straightforward spatial resampling strategy is `spatial_clustering_cv()`, which uses k-means clustering to identify cross-validation folds:

```{r}
library(spatialsample)

set.seed(1234)
folds <- spatial_clustering_cv(boston_canopy, v = 5)

folds
```

In this example, the `boston_canopy` data on tree cover in Boston, MA is resampled with `v = 5`; notice that the resulting partitions do not contain an equal number of observations.

In addition to resampling algorithms, spatialsample provides methods to visualize resamples using [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) through the `autoplot()` function:

```{r}
autoplot(folds)
```

We can use the same function to visualize each fold separately:

```{r boston-anim, animation.hook="gifski", fig.width=7, fig.height=5}
library(purrr)

walk(folds$splits, function(x) print(autoplot(x)))
```

So far, we've only scratched the surface of the functionality spatialsample provides. For more information, check out the [Getting Started](https://spatialsample.tidymodels.org/articles/spatialsample.html) documentation!
