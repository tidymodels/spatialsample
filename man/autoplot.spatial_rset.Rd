\title{Create a ggplot for spatial resamples.}
\usage{
\method{autoplot}{spatial_rset}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{spatial_rset} object or a \code{spatial_rsplit} object.
Note that only resamples made from
\code{sf} objects create \code{spatial_rset} and \code{spatial_rsplit} objects;
this function will not work for
resamples made with non-spatial tibbles or data.frames.}

\item{...}{Options passed to \code{\link[ggplot2:ggsf]{ggplot2::geom_sf()}}.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object with each fold assigned a color, made using
\code{\link[ggplot2:ggsf]{ggplot2::geom_sf()}}.
}
\description{
This method provides a good visualization method for spatial resampling.
}
\details{
The plot method for \code{spatial_rset} displays which fold each observation
is assigned to. Note that if data is assigned to multiple folds
(which is common if resamples were created with a non-zero \code{radius}) only
the "last" fold for each observation will appear on the plot.
Consider adding \code{ggplot2::facet_wrap(~ fold)} to visualize all members of
each fold separately.
Alternatively, consider plotting each split using the \code{spatial_rsplit} method
(for example, via \code{lapply(object$splits, autoplot)}).
