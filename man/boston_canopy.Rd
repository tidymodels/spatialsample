containing 682 records of 22 variables:
\describe{
\item{grid_id}{Unique identifier for each hexagon}

\description{
A dataset containing data on tree canopy coverage and change for the city of
Boston, Massachusetts from 2014-2019,
as well as temperature and heat index data for July 2019. Data is aggregated
to a grid of regular 25 hectare hexagons, clipped to city boundaries.
