Description: Functions and classes for spatial resampling to use with the 
    'rsample' package, including spatial cross-validation (Brenning, 2012) 
    <doi:10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6352393>. The scope of 'rsample' and 
    'spatialsample' is to provide the basic building blocks for creating and
    analyzing resamples of a spatial data set, but neither package includes
    functions for modeling or computing statistics. The resampled spatial data
    sets created by 'spatialsample' do not contain much overhead in memory.
