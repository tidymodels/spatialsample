#' Spatial block cross-validation
#'
#' Block cross-validation splits the area of your data into a number of
#' grid cells, or "blocks", and then assigns all data into folds based on the
#' blocks their centroid falls into.
#'
#' @details
#' The grid blocks can be controlled by passing arguments to
#' [sf::st_make_grid()] via `...`. Some particularly useful arguments include:
#'
#' * `cellsize`: Target cellsize, expressed as the "diameter" (shortest
#' straight-line distance between opposing sides; two times the apothem)
#' of each block, in map units.
#' * `n`: The number of grid blocks in the x and y direction (columns, rows).
#' * `square`: A logical value indicating whether to create square (`TRUE`) or
#' hexagonal (`FALSE`) cells.
#'
#' If both `cellsize` and `n` are provided, then the number of blocks requested
#' by `n` of sizes specified by `cellsize` will be returned, likely not
#' lining up with the bounding box of `data`. If only `cellsize`
#' is provided, this function will return as many blocks of size
#' `cellsize` as fit inside the bounding box of `data`. If only `n` is provided,
#' then `cellsize` will be automatically adjusted to create the requested
#' number of cells.
#'
#' @param data An object of class `sf` or `sfc`.
#' @param method The method used to sample blocks for cross validation folds.
#' Currently supports `"random"`, which randomly assigns blocks to folds,
#' `"snake"`, which labels the first row of blocks from left to right,
#' then the next from right to left, and repeats from there,
#' and `"continuous"`, which labels each row from left
#' to right, moving from the bottom row up.
#' @inheritParams check_v
#' @inheritParams rsample::vfold_cv
#' @param relevant_only For systematic sampling, should only blocks containing
#' data be included in fold labeling?
#' @inheritParams buffer_indices
#' @param ... Arguments passed to [sf::st_make_grid()].
#' @param expand_bbox A numeric of length 1, representing a proportion to expand
#' the bounding box of `data` by before building a grid. Without this expansion,
#' grids built from data in geographic coordinates may exclude observations and
#' grids built from regularly spaced data might have observations fall exactly
#' on the boundary between folds, duplicating them. In spatialsample < 0.5.0,
#' this was 0.00001 for data in a geographic CRS and 0 for data in a planar CRS.
#' In spatialsample > 0.5.0, this is 0.00001 for all data.
#'
#' @return A tibble with classes `spatial_block_cv`,  `spatial_rset`, `rset`,
#'   `tbl_df`, `tbl`, and `data.frame`. The results include a column for the
#'   data split objects and an identification variable `id`.
