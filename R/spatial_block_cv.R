#' Spatial block cross-validation
#'
#' Block cross-validation splits the area of your data into a number of
#' grid cells, or "blocks", and then assigns all data into folds based on the
#' blocks they fall into.
#'
#' @details
#' The grid blocks can be controlled by passing arguments to
#' [sf::st_make_grid()] via `...`. Some particularly useful arguments include:
#'
#' * `cellsize`: Target cellsize, expressed as the "diameter" (shortest
#' straight-line distance between opposing sides; two times the apothem)
#' of each block, in map units.
#' * `n`: The number of grid blocks in the x and y direction (columns, rows).
#' * `square`: A logical value indicating whether to create square (`TRUE`) or
#' hexagonal (`FALSE`) cells.
#'
#' If both `cellsize` and `n` are provided, then the number of blocks requested
#' by `n` of sizes specified by `cellsize` will be returned, likely not
#' lining up with the bounding box of `data`. If only `cellsize`
#' is provided, this function will return as many blocks of size
#' `cellsize` as fit inside the bounding box of `data`. If only `n` is provided,
#' then `cellsize` will be automatically adjusted to create the requested
#' number of cells.
#'
#' @param data An object of class `sf` or `sfc`.
#' @param method The method used to sample blocks for cross validation folds.
#' Currently supports `"random"` and `"systematic"`.
#' @inheritParams rsample::vfold_cv
#' @param ordering For systematic sampling, one of either `"snake"`
#' (the default) or `"continuous"`. The `"snake"` method labels the first row
#' of blocks from left to right, then the next from right to left, and repeats
#' the pattern from there. The `"continuous"` method labels each row from left
#' to right, moving from the bottom row up.
#' @param relevant_only For systematic sampling, should only blocks containing
#' data be included in fold labeling?
#'
#' @param ... Arguments passed to [sf::st_make_grid()].
#'
#' @return A tibble with classes `spatial_block_cv`,  `spatial_rset`, `rset`,
#'   `tbl_df`, `tbl`, and `data.frame`. The results include a column for the
#'   data split objects and an identification variable `id`.
